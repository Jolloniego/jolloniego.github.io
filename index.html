                        Juan is a software engineer, college professor and amateur magician. With a very practical
                        personality, he found his passion in Deep Learning applications with real world impact. </br>
                        His past experience as a software consultant in the financial sector gave him a very peculiar
                        set of skills such as the art of project management, goal orientation, Python programming, and a
                        taste for freshly ironed shirts. </br>
                        As an avid learner who loves reading Juan is always looking forward to new things and keeping up
                        to date with the latest research and state-of-the-art techniques in AI, so that he can add them
                        to his toolbox for future use.
                        He thoroughly enjoys working on every step of the machine learning pipeline, from framing the
                        problem, validating ideas and coming up with small MVPs to shipping them to a production
                        environment affecting thousands of users.

                            It also involved looking at larger completion problems (completing entire lines and blocks
                            of code) and comparing the performance of models trained on different tasks

                            As part of a group project for Deep Learning I worked on reproducing the results and

                            The main challenges of this project were understanding the focus of the proposed research as
                            well as being able to code, train and test the novel neural network architectures proposed
                            in it.

                            The main challenge of this project was dealing with a large and unbalanced dataset and
                            achieving a score comparable to that obtained by the competition leaders.
